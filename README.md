# mason-jar-led-matrix

The Mason Jar LED Matrix is a four by four matrix of 16 LEDs encased within 16 mason jars. The LEDs will be programed to follow a four step sequence. When a jar is pressed or turned the first time the LED within will turn on. If it is pressed a second time the LED will change colors. If pressed again the LED will change to a different color. When the jar is pressed four times it will turn off and the sequence will reset. The LEDs will be controlled by buttons that are placed beneath the jars.
